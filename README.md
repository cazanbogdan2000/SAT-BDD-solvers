# SAT-BDD-solvers

  University homework: implementation, using Python, of two algorithms for
solving SAT problem (the first NP-complete problem that was ever discovered,
thanks to Cook-Levin theorem). Those algorithms are FNC-SAT (based on searching for
the solution, in an exhausistive manner, backtracking like, and returning the 
first solution found, if there is a solution, or a different result, if there is
no solution) and BDD-SAT (binary decision diagram), an algorithm that will cut
the edges of our tree that are not relevant anymore (similar to beta pruning).
  This project also contains some png photos, created using the UNIX gnuplot,
where we can see the graph obtained on those 2 algorithms.
